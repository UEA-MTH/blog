The School of Mathematics is happy to announce that Dr Asaf Karagila is [one of the recipients of the UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship](https://www.ukri.org/news/future-leaders-backed-through-flagship-fellowships/). Asaf was a Newton International Fellow here at UEA for the past two years, and we are very happy to see him stay at the department and flourish.

Asaf's work is in set theory, a branch of pure mathematics, and his project is titled "Understanding the axioms: the interactions of the Axiom of Choice with large cardinal axioms". The research will study the choice-like implications of large cardinal axioms, and will shed new light on these axioms.

You can read about his experience applying for the Future Leaders Fellowship on his [website](http://karagila.org/2020/future-leaders-fellowship/).
