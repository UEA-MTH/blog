Dr Vahagan Aslanyan (University of East Anglia) gives a maths seminar at the School of Mathematics, UEA. The talk is on "A Remark on Atypical Intersections".
The abstract is below.

I will define atypical intersections of algebraic varieties and 
state the Conjecture on Intersections with Tori (CIT) which is a 
Diophantine conjecture generalising Mordell-Lang (in the appropriate 
setting). Although CIT is open, many special cases and weak versions have 
been proven. I will discuss a well-known weak version of CIT and explain 
how it can be generalised using the Mordell-Lang conjecture (which is a 
theorem).
