Mr Nick Williams (University of Leicester) gives a maths seminar at the School of Mathematics, UEA. The talk is on "An algebraic interpretation of the higher Stasheff–Tamari orders".
The abstract is below.

The two higher Stasheff–Tamari orders generalise the 
well-studied Tamari lattice of triangulations of a convex n-gon to higher 
dimensions by considering instead the set of triangulations of a cyclic 
polytope. The orders were implicit in the work of Kapranov and Voevodsky, 
but were first defined explicitly by Edelman and Reiner, who conjectured 
them to be equal. Edelman and Reiner showed this to hold in low 
dimensions, but the general result is still unknown. Meanwhile, on the 
algebraic side, Oppermann and Thomas connected triangulations of 
even-dimensional cyclic polytopes with the tilting modules over Iyama’s 
higher Auslander algebras of type A. In this talk I outline recent work in 
which I show how the higher Stasheff–Tamari orders fit into the algebraic 
picture of Oppermann and Thomas. Indeed, it turns out that they coincide 
with higher-dimensional versions of orders on tilting modules studied by 
Happel, Unger, Riedtmann, and Schofield.
