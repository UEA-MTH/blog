Andreea Mocanu (University of Nottingham) gives a maths seminar at the School of Mathematics, UEA. The talk is on "On the relation between Jacobi forms and elliptic 
modular forms"".
The abstract is below.

Jacobi forms arise naturally in number theory, for example as 
functions of lattices or as Fourier-Jacobi coefficients of other types of 
modular forms. They have applications in algebraic geometry, string theory 
and the theory of vertex operator algebras, among other areas. We are 
interested in establishing a precise connection between Jacobi forms of 
lattice index and elliptic modular forms, in order to transfer information 
from one side to the other. In this talk, we illustrate this connection 
via an example, namely that of Jacobi forms whose indices are the root 
lattices of type D_n.
