Dr Javier Rodriguez-Rodriguez (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Leganes, Spain) gives a research webinar hosted by the School of Mathematics, UEA. The talk is on "Dip-coating flow in the presence of two immiscible liquids".
The abstract is below.

Watch the recording of the talk [here](https://youtu.be/EEFlHT7hpAc).

Dip-coating is a common technique used to cover a solid surface with a thin liquid film, the thickness of which was successfully predicted by the theory developed by Landau & Levich and Derjaguin in the 1940â€™s. 

In this work, we present an extension of their theory to the case where the dipping bath contains two immiscible liquids, one lighter than the other, resulting in the entrainment of two thin films on the substrate. We report how the thicknesses of the coated films depend on the ratios of the properties of the two liquids, as well as on the dimensionless thickness of the supernatant layer. We also show that the coated thicknesses are essentially determined by the local stresses at the liquid/liquid and liquid/air interfaces, at the point where these interfaces are closest to one another.
