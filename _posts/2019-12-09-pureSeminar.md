Prof. Dan Ciubotaru (University of Oxford) gives a maths seminar at the School of Mathematics, UEA. The talk is on "Dirac operators and Hecke algebras".
The abstract is below.

I will explain the construction and main properties of Dirac 
operators for representations of various Hecke-type algebras (e.g., 
Lusztig's graded Hecke algebra for p-adic groups, Drinfeld's Hecke 
algebras, rational Cherednik algebras). The approach is motivated by the 
classical Dirac operator which acts on sections of spinor bundles over 
Riemannian symmetric spaces, and by its algebraic version for 
Harish-Chandra modules of real reductive groups. The algebraic Dirac 
theory developed for these Hecke algebras turns out to lead to interesting 
applications: e.g., a Springer parameterisation of projective 
representations of finite Weyl groups (in terms of the geometry of the 
nilpotent cone of complex semisimple Lie algebras), spectral gaps for 
unitary representations of reductive p-adic groups, connections between 
the Calogero-Moser space and Kazhdan-Lusztig double cells. I will present 
some of these applications in the talk.
