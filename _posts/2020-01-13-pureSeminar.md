Dr Katerina Hristova (University of East Anglia) gives a maths seminar at the School of Mathematics, UEA. The talk is on "Representations of locally compact totally disconnected groups and complete Kac-Moody groups".
The abstract is below.

We study smooth representations of locally compact totally disconnected groups acting continuously on simplicial sets. We discuss some interesting properties of the category of smooth representations of such groups, in particular, its projective dimension and localisation theory. We use our results to obtain information about the representation theory of complete Kac-Moody groups over a finite field. Joint work with Dmitriy Rumynin.
