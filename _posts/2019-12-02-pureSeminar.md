Mr Dimitris Michailidis (University of Kent) gives a maths seminar at the School of Mathematics, UEA. The talk is on "On bases and BGG resolutions of Temperley-Lieb algebras of type B".
The abstract is below.

Inspired from the study of certain models in physics, Martin and 
Saleur defined the Temperley-Lieb algebra of type B or blob algebra as the 
diagrammatic two parameter generalisation of the Temperley-Lieb algebra of 
type A. The blob algebra can also be viewed as quotient of the Hecke 
algebra of type B, hence it is isomorphic to a quotient of the (graded) 
KLR algebra via the Brundan-Kleshchev isomorphism. In this talk we shall 
construct bases of the simple representations for the blob algebra, 
indexed by paths in the Euclidean space with respect to the alcove 
geometry of affine type A1. We also prove that to each simple 
representation we attach a resolution of cell modules, called BGG 
resolution, which gives homological construction of simple 
representations.
