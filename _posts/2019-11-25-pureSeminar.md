Mr Lewis Topley (University of Birmingham) gives a maths seminar at the School of Mathematics, UEA. The talk is on "The dimensions of modules for Lie algebras in positive 
characteristics".
The abstract is below.

One of the main goals in representation theory is to understand 
simple modules for a chosen class of algebraic objects. Lie algebras are 
one of the most classical algebraic structures: they arise naturally as 
the infinitesimal analogues of (continuous) groups. Over the complex 
numbers representations of Lie algebras have been studied extensively and 
the situation is quite well-understood, although many mysteries still 
remain. Over fields of positive characteristics however, the situation is 
more complicated. I will begin this talk by giving a gentle introduction 
to this field, comparing the ordinary and the modular.

In the second half of the talk I will describe a joint work with Ben 
Martin and David Stewart in which we apply the Leftschetz principle, along 
with classical techniques from Lie theory, to prove (a generic version of) 
a conjecture of Kac and Weisfeiler from 1971, describing the maximal 
dimension of simple modules over a Lie algebra in positive characteristic.
