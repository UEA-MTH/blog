Prof. Linda Cummings (New Jersey Institute of Technology) gives a research seminar at the School of Mathematics, UEA. The talk is on "Modeling and large-scale simulation of thin film liquid flows".
The abstract is below.

Thin film flows of nematic liquid crystal will be considered, using the Leslie-Eriksen formulation for nematics.  Our model can account for variations in substrate anchoring, which may exert a strong influence on patterns that arise in the flow.  A number of simulations will be presented using an "in-house" code, developed to run on a GPU.  Current modeling directions involving flow over interlaced electrodes, so-called "dielectrowetting" will be discussed.
