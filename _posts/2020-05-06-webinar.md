Dr Davide Proment (University of East Anglia) gives a research webinar at the [ICMS Waves in One World series](https://sites.google.com/view/waves-ow/). The talk is on "Sound emission and irreversible dynamics during vortex reconnections in quantum fluids".

To wacth the seminar online follow the details [here](https://sites.google.com/view/waves-ow/webinar-details).

The abstract is below.

We study the irreversible dynamics of vortex reconnections in quantum fluids within the framework of the Grossâ€“Pitaevskii model, a nonlinear Schroedinger-type equation. We quantitatively explain the time-asymmetry characterising the reconnection process by relating it to the emission of localised directional sound pulse. Our theoretical results shed new light on energy transfer and turbulence in fluid mechanics and have the prospect of being tested in quantum fluid experiments.
