Prof. Kevin Buzzard (Imperial College London) gives a pure maths webinar for the School of Mathematics, UEA. The talk is on "When will computers prove theorems?".

The abstract is below.

Computers are used by researchers to do "number crunching" -- huge computations which would be completely unfeasible to do by hand. Computers could calculate the first 10000 prime numbers in a fraction of a second, for example. But computers can still only do a finite amount of stuff in a finite time. Can a computer prove that there are *infinitely many* prime numbers? Currently the answer is "with some help". What kinds of things can computers prove by themselves? Can they do undergraduate problem sheets? Should we be training undergraduates to use them? What does the future hold? I will give an introduction to the area of computer proof systems. No background knowledge in computers will be needed.
