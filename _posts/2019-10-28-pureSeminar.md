Nadav Meir (Imperial College London) gives a maths seminar at the School of Mathematics, UEA. The talk is on "O-minimality, pseudo-o-minimality: on first-order properties of semialgebraic sets".
The abstract is below.

A semialgebraic set is a set given by the real solutions to a 
finite set of polynomial equations and inequalities. In Grothendieck’s 
Esquisse d’un Programme he suggested the following challenge: Investigate 
classes of sets with the tame topological properties of semialgebraic 
sets. O-minimality is model theory's response to Grothendieck's challenge; 
it is a property of ordered structures exhibiting the "tame" topological 
properties of semialgebraic sets, such as cell decompositions and 
stratifications. With applications both within and outside of model 
theory, the notion of an o-minimal structure has proven to be increasingly 
useful, with applications varying from real algebraic and real analytic 
geometry to economics and machine learning.

An elementary result on o-minimal structures states that any structure 
satisfying the same first-order sentences as an o-minimal structure is 
itself o-minimal. Despite that fact, there is no axiomatization of 
o-minimality by a set of first-order sentences; this can be seen by taking 
ultraproducts, as we will see.

In this talk, we will review the definition and key results of 
o-minimality. We will then survey a few first-order properties of 
semialgebraic sets, each property "tame" in its own way, generalizing the 
tameness of o-minimal structures. We will end by discussing structures 
satisfying all first-order properties which hold in every o-minimal 
structure, what tameness properties these structures satisfy and how they 
can be axiomatized.
