Mr Diego Millan Berdasco (Queen Mary) gives a maths seminar at the School of Mathematics, UEA. The talk is on "On decomposition numbers of the symmetric group".
The abstract is below.

Modular representation theory of the symmetric group studies the restrictions to finite characteristic of the irreducible modules of the group algebra C\S_n: the Specht modules. Given a certain natural number, we know it decomposes uniquely as a finite product of powers of prime numbers. Similarly, a Specht module has a unique decomposition into simple modules each with a certain multiplicity. Finding these multiplicities, called decomposition numbers, is the most important open problem in this theory. In this talk we generalise an early result by G. D. James, and give a new family of decomposition numbers for each Specht module.
