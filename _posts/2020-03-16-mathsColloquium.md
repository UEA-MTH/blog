Prof. David Goldberg (Purdue University, US) gives a maths colloquium at the School of Mathematics, UEA. The talk is on "The Math Alliance: History and Lessons".
The abstract is below.

Growing out of an effort at the University of Iowa in the late 1990’s, the Math Alliance has grown in the USA to a national mentoring community of over 1,000 faculty mentors, which has worked with over 2,100 students over the past dozen years. The Math Alliance is an organization devoted to producing more doctorates in the mathematical sciences (writ large) among traditionally underrepresented groups: African Americans, Latinx Americans, American Indians, Native Alaskans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  The Math Alliance has seen over 100 of these students receive doctoral degrees, most since 2013. With a recent (six-year old) Math Alliance program to address issues of the transition to graduate school just beginning to pay dividends, and well over 300 more doctorates in the pipeline, this has become a success story which could have hardly been imagined from its beginnings.  In this talk we will discuss this history, why it is remarkable, how we intend prevent it from dying off, how we view these results impacting our profession, and what direction we see the future moving in.  We’ll also discuss what we have learned about building a more inclusive mathematical professional workspace, and how many of those lessons can be applied to other areas, as well as other settings.
