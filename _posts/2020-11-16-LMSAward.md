Good news for UEAMTH!
One of our maths PhD students, Mr Carl-Fredrik Nyberg Brodda, won a prize for the best talk at the London Mathematical Society Virtual Graduate Student Meeting 2020 (one year after winning a similar award, see [here](https://ueamth.github.io/blog/award/2019/06/28/LMSAward.html)!). His talk was on "The B. B. Newman Spelling Theorem". 

Details of the meeting can be found [here](https://www.lms.ac.uk/events/london-mathematical-society-virtual-graduate-student-meeting-2020).
