Dr Michikazu Kobayashi (Kyoto University) gives a research seminar at the School of Mathematics, UEA. The talk is on "Energy and helicity cascades in non-Abelian quantum turbulence".
The abstract is below.

Quantum turbulence is realized as a dynamically and temporally complicated
structure of quantized vortices in quantum fluid such as superfluid helium
and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. In this seminar, I talk about non-Abelian
quantum turbulence comprised of non-Abelian quantized vortices, the topological
charge of which is classified by the non-Abelian group. Being different from
reconnecting dynamics of Abelian vortices, non-Abelian vortices show the
formation of rung vortices when they collide keeping their linking topology.
As a result, non-Abelian quantum turbulence shows a large-scale networking
structure of vortices in which almost all vortices are connected.
We also find several kinds of cascading processes in the wave-number space:
inverse and direct cascades of the mass kinetic energy and helicity, respcetively,
and direct cascade of the spin kinetic energy. I will show the expecting
scenario connecting the dynamics of vortices and cascading processes.
Our prediction can be tested in, for example, the cyclic phase of a spin-2
spinor Bose-Einstein condensate.
